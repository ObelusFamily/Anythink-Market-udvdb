## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_

1) First, run the following command in the directory you wish to create the repo:
    git clone https://github.com/ObelusFamily/Anythink-Market-udvdb.git
2) Next, create your own branch and add the CODEOWNERS file, then remove Carl from the file and commit your changes to git. 
3) Now, you can create a pull request
